### 1. The importance of context

- Exploratory vs explanatory graphics.
	- Exploratory is for the analyst.
	- Exploratory is for the audience.
- Who is the audience, who is the stakeholder?
- What do you need your audience to know or do?
- How will you communicate to your audience? Live or written by email?
- What tone do you want your communication to set?
- What data is available that will help make your point?
- If you had 3 minutes to tell a story, what would be the big idea : the unique point of view in one sentence?
- Let's now move to storyboarding.

### 2. Choosing an effective visual

- Go with a simple text or a figure.
-  Available charts: scatterplot, table, lines, slopegraph, vertical bars, horizontal bars, stacked vertical bars, stacked horizontal bars, waterfall, square areas.
- Table? Never in a live presentation (too dense).
- Heatmap? Never! A better alternative is a slopegraph.
- Color saturation is for visual contrast: put everything  in B&W except the one thing you want to draw attention on.
- Speak in relative, not in absolute: scatterplot, average, percentage, waterfall (change, increment), areas for comparing categories.
- Avoid clutter and 3D, avoid saturated series and secondary axes.
- Prefer a zero baseline and equal scales among several graphics.
- Prefer square forms over round forms.
	- Avoid pie charts or donut charts.
	- Prefer a horizontal bar chart.

### 3. Clutter is your enemy !

- Avoid cognitive load: a simple chart, a few line, one image.
- Avoid borders (limited to the L axes), avoid gridlines and background shading. 
- The y-axis is often facultative.
- Clean up axis labels; summarize labels (Jan vs January)
- Bold and colors is for making the important stand out.
- Limit to 2 or 3 colors.
- Add white space.
- Add details to the important areas (annotate).
- Add the legend on the graph, not outside.

### 4. Focus your audience’s attention

- Use preattentive attributes in text : bold, italics, separate spatially, underlined, more tone or color (B&W), data stand out, numbered data, size.
-  Avoid shades of red and green.
- Use preattentive attributes in visual : difference in orientation, shape, length, width, size, curvature, added marks, enclosure, hue, intensity, spatial position, motion
- Position on the page follows the 1-2-3-4 loop.
- Consult:
	- Cultural Color Connotations, David McCandless.
	- The Visual Miscellaneum : A Colourful Guide to the World’s Most Consequential Trivia.

### 5. Think like a designer

- Eliminate distractions.
- Not all data are equally important.
- When detail is not needed, summarize.
- Would eliminating 'this' change anything?
- Push necessary, but non-message-impacting items to the background.
- The power of subcategories, subdivisions.
- Legible, clean, straightforward language.
- Action titles.

### 7. Lessons in storytelling

- Write a story with a schema (3 acts)
- Write a narrative structure (hero's journey)
- Use the power of repetition: 3, 7, 12, 30, 40, 100, 500, 1000.

### 10. Final thoughts

- Learn your tools well.
	- Google Spreadsheet, Tableau, R, D3 (JavaScript), Processing, Python, etc.
- Iterate.
- Devote time to storytelling with data.
- Seek inspiration throught good examples.
- Find your style.
- Consult websites.
