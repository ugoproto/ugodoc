## Time

1- **Reporting**: perform descriptive analytics. Tell what happened.

2- **Explanatory survey**: analyze what people or objects are up to. Ask people what they think about something. Conceive a statistical model; what factors drive others.

3- **Prediction**: perform predictive analytics. Use historical data, add a statistical model, probabilities, and assumptions,  predict the future. Find out what customers are likely to buy. Assess how likely it is for an event to happen. Forecast economic conditions. 

## Focus

4- **What**: tell what happened with a *focus* on one issue (**Reporting** is not as focused).

5- **Why**: tell what underlying factors caused the outcome. *Focus* on the outcome.

6- **How** to address the issue: explore various ways to improve the situation. *Focus* on the situation.

## Depth

7- **CSI**: run a small, ad hoc investigation. Find out why something is happening. Find out why some customer are dropping online transactions when they get to the postal code input form; what if some rural locations don't have postal codes?

8- **Eureka**: invest in long, analytically-driven searches for a solution to a complex problem. Discover the right way to refer and price potential buyers to real estate agents on a website. Since the project is core to the company's business model, it needs a corporate buy-in. The project involve several different analytical methods, false starts, dead-ends, discoveries.

## Methods

9- **Correlations**: find why the relationships among variables rise and fall at the same time. 

10- **Causation**: argue that one variable caused the other. Controlled experiment.

## Afterword

- These 10 approaches are not mutually exclusive. 
- Begin the report with the result and recommended outcome. Follow with the demonstration.
- For the c-suite, keep technical terms to the minimum.
